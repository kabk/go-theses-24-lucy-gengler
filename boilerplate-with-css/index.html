						<h2>Abstract</h2>

						<p>
							When everything is changing constantly, moving at lightning speed, there is often no time
							and energy to care for others. It’s more convenient to send an SMS than a letter to someone.
							And as we have isolated ourselves, our trust in strangers has shifted, care and intimacy
							have shifted. This thesis explores how we could reshape our vision in finding small mundane
							rituals that could help us bring more resilience to build community.
						</p>
						<p>
							For this research, I explore the historical framework of care, provided by feminist thinkers
							like Silvia Federici, alongside perspectives from feminist filmmakers such as Chantal
							Akerman and Anna Hints. The artists’ works highlight the perception of care work as
							invisible and traditionally categorized as women’s work to bring attention of this
							significant issue. Yet, collectives such as the ‘Casco Art Institute & Annette Kraus’ are
							suggesting approaches that encourage us to rethink our societal constructs, for instance by
							engaging in collective exercises.
						</p>
						<p>
							Building on this foundation, I look into psychological concepts like the gift economy, by
							activist Charles Eisenstein and the author Lewis Hyde. Here, the notion of the gift emerges
							as a powerful tool for fostering human connection and community. I delve into rituals that
							nurture connection and intimacy, such as letter exchanges, which transcend individualism and
							cultivate collectivity. My journey has been one of immersion, receiving care from gardeners,
							letter writers, and artists alike, and absorbing the gifts they offer.
						</p>
						<p>
							Within this framework, I uncover the profound significance of rituals. They serve as vessels
							that transport care from individualism to community, forming a continuous cycle of giving
							and receiving. Ultimately, they foster a sense of of belonging, creating tighter bonds
							within our communities.

							<h2>Introduction</h2>

							<p> Going home to visit my grandparents is exciting, not only because I get to see them, but
								also because I get to visit my grandfather’s garden – a magical place filled with plants
								and
								flowers. This place has always been more than just a plot of land, it’s grows with time
								and
								is created from genuine care for a space. He assures its longevity by taking care of it
								and
								when I receive something my grandfather cultivated, it feels like receiving a treasure –
								a
								tangible result of his hard work.

							</p>

							<p>
								Sometimes, I find myself engaged in this kind of work too and eventually I find similar
								treasures along the way. For instance, when I went mushroom gathering in the forest with
								my
								roommate Khaled. We drove beyond the landscapes of the city, trading asphalt for wet
								grass.
								It was a cold, rainy day, and we were covered in warm sweaters, rain jackets and rubber
								boots. I can still feel the raindrops on my cheek and the sound of the boots in the mud,
								searching for fungi. Finding them was tough. Only after an hour, we stumbled across a
								porcino mushroom<sup><a href="#" class="footnote-ref"
										data-footnote-id="footnote1">⋆.ೃ࿔*:･</a></sup>

								<span id="footnote1" class="footnote-content" style="display: none;">
									<sup>⋆.ೃ࿔*:･</sup> One of the most widely consumed wild mushrooms that grows during
									autumn
									mostly in North America and Europe and is known for its rich earthy and nutty flavor
									(22).
								</span>
								and soon our basket was filled with them, creating an unspoken sense of bliss. Despite
								being
								cold and soaked and in the middle of nowhere, I felt warmth. When we got back home,
								Khaled
								prepared the mushrooms, being careful that none of them were toxic.
							</p>

									</a>
								</div>
								<figcaption class="image-caption">
									While gathering mushrooms, we stumbled upon a beautiful coral-fungus (lat.:
									Artomyces pyxidatus).
									This fungi thrives during the summer months on decaying logs and branches. However,
									the increasing use of dead wood for heating is putting its natural habitat at risk,
									potentially endangering its existence.

								</figcaption>
							</figure>

							<p>
								Naturally, we look after our friends and family, but care and empathy for someone can
								also
								extend beyond social circles, to strangers. An example is the study “You Turn Me Cold”,
								where researchers invited healthy individuals to watch videos of strangers putting their
								hands into iced water.<a id="bibref-1" href="#reference1" class="bibliography"
									data-bibliography-id="reference1"><sup>[1]</sup> </a>
								In response to these images, the temperature of the participant’s
								own hands dropped. This phenomenon is called “temperature contagion”. It underlines the
								idea
								that in social interactions, we respond to one another. Even if we see people we don’t
								know
								experiencing physical discomfort or shock, our bodies respond accordingly, just as they
								would for someone close to us. The outcome of this study shows the depth of our empathy
								for
								strangers and the potential for fostering a more connected society.
							</p>

							<p>
								Despite the power for connection, we might feel as if there is a loss in collectivity.
								Especially since the pandemic, social distancing and wearing masks have contributed to
								isolation and loneliness. All around us, there appears to be a shared anxiety that is
								caused
								by living in a world that seems uncaring.<a id="bibref-2" href="#reference2"
									class="bibliography" data-bibliography-id="reference2">[2]</a> It is difficult to
								achieve common goals
								when
								our self-interest grows and feeds into individualistic behavior. Our narcisstic mindsets
								make us forget to listen to the needs of others.<a id="bibref-3" href="#reference3"
									class="bibliography" data-bibliography-id="reference3">[3]</a> And instead of
								drawing closer, we have
								perfected the art of drifting apart. When standing so far apart, it is difficult to
								achieve
								common goals. This contributes to a lack of cooperation and social unrest. It will
								ultimately lead to discrimination and conflict. To prevent us from drifting apart even
								further, we should consider rethinking old habits and creating new communal rituals that
								engage collective participation.
							</p>

							<p>
								Charles Eisenstein (a degrowth activist<sup><a href="#" class="footnote-ref"
										data-footnote-id="footnote2">ೄྀ࿐✦</a></sup>) illustrates this
								<span id="footnote2" class="footnote-content" style="display: none;">
									<sup>ೄྀ࿐✦</sup>Degrowth activism is a movement that promotes societies in which
									social
									and ecological well-being is prioritized over corporate profits, excessive
									production
									and consumption.
								</span>approach by rebuilding human connections and learning practical skills in a life
								less
								dependent on money. He introduces
								the principle of the ‘gift economy’, where a community exchanges assistance and
								gratitude
								without the use of money.<a id="bibref-4" href="#reference4" class="bibliography"
									data-bibliography-id="reference4">[4]</a> In this system, generosity is seen as a
								form
								of wealth, so
								“the more you give, the richer you are”. According to Eisenstein, money is intended to
								be
								the representation of society’s appreciation for an individual’s contributions, yet the
								professions with high monetary compensations often don’t have significant contributions
								to
								society’s wellbeing.
							</p>

							<p>
								Much like the plants in my grandfather’s garden, this piece of writing is nourished by
								the
								roots of care by investigating its history, it flourishes under the tender care of case
								studies across fields of activism, psychology and design, and branches out in various
								directions, for instance everyday-life rituals. All with the intention of how rituals of
								giving and receiving can transcend individualism and foster connection and community.

						<h2 id="chapter-1">The Roots</h2>


						<h3 id="subchapter-1.1">The 'Housewife'</h3>

						<p>
							Already during childhood, girls are introduced early to caregiving roles and tasks. When I
							was five, I had my own pretend kitchen with plastic food and kitchen utensils. Or when I
							played with friends, we often walked around with buggys and baby dolls, taking turns with
							feeding, playing and assuming the role of being “mothers”. When my mother, who had trained
							to be a chef, became a housewife after my sister and I were born it became clear that being
							a “mother” meant being a housewife.

						</p>

						<p>
							The artist Chantal Akerman<sup><a href="#" class="footnote-ref"
									data-footnote-id="footnote3">°•. ✿ .•°</a></sup>
							<span id="footnote3" class="footnote-content" style="display: none;">
								<sup>°•. ✿ .•°</sup>At age 25, Chantal Akerman created the film “Jeanne Dielman 23 Quai
								Du Commerce 1080 Bruxelles” for which she was renowned an influential avant-garde
								feminist filmmakers.<a id="bibref-20" href="#reference20" class="bibliography"
									data-bibliography-id="reference4">[20]</a>
							</span>, whose mother was a housewife as well, beautifully portrays a
							housewife’s everyday life in her film “Jeanne Dielman 23 Quai Du Commerce 1080 Bruxelles”.<a
								id="bibref-5" href="#reference5" class="bibliography"
								data-bibliography-id="reference5">[5]</a> The
							3-hour long film depicts the daily routines of a housewife in real-time. Watching
							Jeanne Dielman peel potatoes, take a bath and cooking soup becomes boring and lonely. By
							keeping the shots long and uncut, the film captures the slow and monotous aspects of
							domestic work. This film emphasizes the mundane, offering perhaps the most authentic
							depiction of the housewife’s experience.

						</figure>

						<h3 id="subchapter-1.2">Labour of Love</h3>

						<p>
							Housework is boring, exhausting, and often seen as a labour of love. In “Wages Against
							Housework”, feminist theorist Silvia Federici explains that people often don’t recognize
							housework as actual work because it is seen as a way to show your love and appreciation.<a
								id="bibref-6" href="#reference6" class="bibliography"
								data-bibliography-id="reference6">[6]</a>
							This setup is idealized and reinforced through the capitalist patriarchy, portraying the
							housewife as a support for the male worker in their physical, emotional and sexual needs.
							Where everyone is led to believe that women’s domestic duties are simply a natural and
							fulfilling part of life. In fact, it is the “pillar, the foundation” of all other work,
							because it enables us to stay productive. Most men think about marriage after securing their
							first job, not just because they can afford it, but also because being able to go home to
							someone who takes care of them is the only way to stay sane after a long day of work.

						<p>
							The collective Casco Team & Annette Kraus demonstrates the potential for executing care
							tasks collectively in order to emphasize equality, fairness and mutual recognition. Their
							project “Unlearning Exercises”, presents a series of practical exercises that aim to nurture
							a more inclusive and collective environment.<a id="bibref-7" href="#reference7"
								class="bibliography" data-bibliography-id="reference7">[7]</a> The activities range from
							mundane chores
							such as cleaning together to address issues such as fair pay. Moreover, the work gives an
							insight into the power of communal learning. Through active participation in these
							exercises, they engage in discussions, pose questions, and share personal narratives. By
							coming together to clean every Thursday, the group transforms the routine task into a
							meaningful ritual, challenging traditional norms and actively seeking societal change within
							their community.

						<p>
							After 14 years of marriage, my parents divorced. My mother returned to work as a chef again,
							because her domestic labor didn’t bring money. I’ve always admired her profession. Yet, to
							this day, I hear her advice: “Never become a chef, it’s thankless.” and “People don’t see
							you.” The hard work in the kitchen often goes unnoticed, kitchen atmospheres are intense and
							the pay is low. We live in a society that judges an individual’s value based on how much
							money they make, what they consume and the potential profit from their job. This judgment
							also reinforces the idea of caregiving work as work that is either minimal or lacking in
							skill. The reality is that cooking, cleaning and caring are jobs with the lowest wages and
							the most instability in capitalist societies. The undervaluation and underpayment of
							domestic labour contribute to lower wages in other sectors.<a id="bibref-8"
								href="#reference8" class="bibliography" data-bibliography-id="reference8">[8]</a> In
							situations where the
							primary caregiver executes demanding and time-consuming work, but remains unpaid, the labour
							does not have value because it cannot be exploited for profit.<a id="bibref-9"
								href="#reference9" class="bibliography" data-bibliography-id="reference9">[9]</a> In
							today’s society, not
							much seems to have value if it cannot be monetized. Perhaps the most valuable thing anyone
							can do in a capitalist society is to do nothing at all. Or to visit the sauna.
						</p>

						<h3 id="subchapter-1.3">The Sauna</h3>

						<p>
							In the documentary film “Smoke Sauna Sisterhood” by Anna Hints, women gather in a hot sauna
							in the Estonian forests.<a id="bibref-10" href="#reference10" class="bibliography"
								data-bibliography-id="reference10">[10]</a> They engage in rituals or share personal
							stories with each
							other without fear of judgment. They create a profound connection with each other by showing
							care for each other’s emotional burdens. With their connection they celebrate womanhood and
							care. One of the stories that stuck with me was when one woman’s family didn’t ask her about
							her trip when she came home after a long time. To ask about how she had been doing while she
							was away meant showing care, and care is seen as a ‘weakness’. They didn’t want to show the
							vulnerability to her.

						</p>

						<p>
							In our society, there is a common belief that being emotional and openly expressing feelings
							is synonymous with weakness. From childhood on, many have been told phrases such as “don’t
							cry, be strong”, implying that showing vulnerability is being weak. Especially boys are
							taught that “boys don’t cry”, because showing themselves hurt or sad is not masculine. They
							internalize these messages in order to fit in and gain validation from their male peers and
							authority figures.<a id="bibref-3" href="#reference3" class="bibliography"
								data-bibliography-id="reference3">[3]</a> As a result, not only do we have the constant
							pressure of proving
							ourselves the strong and confident person that society wants us to be, but we also learn to
							hide our feelings from a young age

						</p>

						<p>

							The anecdote from the sauna illustrates that the family lacks expressions of care.
							Nonetheless,
							the rituals of the sauna give the woman the space to be vulnerable and share her experience,
							free from fear of judgment. Learning to openly express her emotions, she discovered that in
							fact, showing care is not a weakness, but it fostered a sense of community.

						<h3 id="subchapter-2.1">Love, Letters and Gifts</h3>

						<p>
							Finding a handwritten letter on my doorstep never fails to excite me. Probably because in
							today’s world of fast social media messaging, it has become a rarity <sup><a href="#"
									class="footnote-ref" data-footnote-id="footnote4">◛⑅·˚ ༘ ♡</a></sup>
							<span id="footnote4" class="footnote-content" style="display: none;">
								<sup>◛⑅·˚ ༘ ♡</sup>Since 2014, European postal traffic has significantly decreased of
								more than 50%. From 66 billion letters sent out in 2014, to only 33 billion letters in
								2020. Consequently, the number of postal letter boxes across Europe has decreased by 11%
								during the same period.<a id="bibref-21" href="#reference21" class="bibliography"
									data-bibliography-id="reference21">[21]</a>
							</span> – a treasure even.
							There is just not enough time and energy to sit down for the creation of a handwritten
							letter. Once I hold one in my hand, I am reminded of the personal touch that sets it apart
							from the digital exchanges we are so used to. There is more to a handwritten letter than
							just pure text; it comes with scribbles, crossed-out words, and coffee stains. Human marks
							that make it a special and unique piece.
						</p>

						<p>
							Yearning for analogue exchange remains important in my family. After my uncle came out to
							his parents, his father stopped recognizing him as his son. Instead of confronting him
							directly, my uncle sent him a letter. Handwritten letters can be a slower but more
							thoughtful way to communicate, especially in difficult situations such as arguments or
							misunderstandings. They allow us to understand deeper expressions of regret, concern, and
							forgiveness.
						</p>

						<p>

							But it’s not only about conveying information, but also expressing genuine concern through
							carefully crafted messages. With everyone in the family scattered across different cities
							(and
							countries), sending letters has become a way to stay connected. An intimate act that brings
							closeness to the physical distance between us.

						</p>

						<p>
							Ever since I was a child, I’ve observed packages coming in and out of the house. Every now
							and then a big package would stand on the kitchen table, and we would all gather around.
							They were packages from my grandmother. My mother received magazines, jam (or other food)
							and a letter from her mother. My sister and I got candy or sometimes practical items such as
							socks and underwear. About a week later, it would be my mother’s turn to send a package back
							to her. Since she left home at 16, moving from a village in East Germany to Frankfurt and
							then to Luxembourg, my grandmother and her have been apart.
							Exchanging items has evolved from a way to stay connected into a ritual. In the end, the
							contents in the packages (even if sentimental) remain mere objects. The significance lies in
							the actual act of continuous giving and receiving. Similar to a gift, where one gives and
							gets something in return, the objects have to stay in constant motion.<a id="bibref-11"
								href="#reference11" class="bibliography" data-bibliography-id="referenc11">[11]</a> My
							mother didn’t
							hoard the jam; rather, she graciously shared it with us, so it can be enjoyed together.

						</p>


						<p>
							In contrast to the traditional approach, where care work often flowed from one person, to
							another, we observe that this exchange is mututal between two equal parties. It’s dynamic of
							both giving and receiving, shifting away from one-sided giving. Consequently, it was on my
							mother to send a package.
						</p>

						<p>
							Initiating this practice of the gifting ritual is more comfortable within friendships or
							family. However, as mentioned earlier, I am also intrigued by the power of care, empathy,
							and connection towards strangers. In “The Gift” by Lewis Hyde, the author illustrates how
							even simple mundane gestures, like sharing candy, offering a cigarette, or exchanging brief
							words of encouragement, can be seen as a gift because it creates a connection.<a
								id="bibref-11" href="#reference11" class="bibliography"
								data-bibliography-id="referenc11">[11]</a> This
							connection is a bond that distinguishes the act of giving and receiving from mere
							transactions<sup><a href="#" class="footnote-ref" data-footnote-id="footnote5">.·:*¨
									¨*:·.</a></sup>
							<span id="footnote5" class="footnote-content" style="display: none;">
								<sup>.·:*¨ ¨*:·.</sup>Transactions refer to exchanges involving paid services or bought
								objects.
							</span> and creates profound connection.

						</p>



						<p>
							The theme of connection and forming this bond is related to a project I’m working on
							parallel to my research. This project plays on the boundaries of anonymity and intimacy,
							where I ask strangers questions I don’t know the answer to. I am reaching out to people by
							placing envelopes in diverse locations: outdoor mini libraries, park benches, tram stops,
							etc. Each envelope is unique and comes with a question, a pen and paper. Its’s an invitation
							for strangers to engage with one of the many wonders that occupy my thoughts. This journey
							of going through my own uncertainties while connecting with others blurs the line between
							strangers and acquaintances. I also hope that it starts conversations, connections, and
							unexpected discoveries.
						</p>

						<h3 id="subchapter-2.2">Nurturing</h3>

						<p>
							When we care for others, we have a genuine desire to help each other grow and thrive.
							Similar to how Erich Fromm defines love, who says it’s “the will to extend one’s self for
							the purpose of nurturing one’s own or another’s spiritual growth”.<a id="bibref-12"
								href="#reference12" class="bibliography" data-bibliography-id="referenc12">[12]</a>
							When we nurture each other, we feed each other. This basic human act holds more meaning than
							just mere survival. When we nurture each other, we take part in generously sharing
							resources, whether it’s food, time, attention, skills or money. Ultimately, by engaging in
							these acts, we connect with each other. Here is an example to illustrate it further:

						</p>

						<p>
							One of the ways in which the video creator Brad Lancaster looks for human connection is by
							eating together with strangers.<a id="bibref-13" href="#reference13" class="bibliography"
								data-bibliography-id="referenc13">[13]</a> Food is often the center point for gathering
							that
							focuses on building community because it sparks discussions that delve into topics of
							nourishment, sustainability, economy, ritual and history.<a id="bibref-14"
								href="#reference14" class="bibliography" data-bibliography-id="referenc14">[14]</a> In
							one of his videos, him and
							his friend knock on people’s doors in Compton in hope of finding people for whom they could
							cook dinner for. Despite Compton’s reputation for its infamously high crime rate and one of
							the most dangerous places in Los Angeles, they find a family willing to take part in the
							social experiment. Because of how big the family was, they went out on a whim and curiously
							managed to get the help of Andre Rush, the personal chef of the White House who served four
							administrations. His willingness to fly in and cook for a family of strangers underlines his
							profound dedication to his profession and his belief in the power of human connection. He
							explains that since having served in the military, cooking became his coping tool, like
							therapy. He continues by saying that “food is that one universal thing that just brings
							everyone together” without domination, race, color, it “goes throughout the universe”. Him
							being there and cooking dinner for a family of strangers is his way of giving back. In this
							exchange, nourishment flows both ways. When we invest generosity into a gift, it grows and
							feeds us in return. The gift embodies a spirit which thrives through circulation.<a

						<h2 id="chapter-3">The Compost</h2>

						<h3 id="subchapter-3.1">Hidden Gardens</h3>

						<p>
							I grew up amidst nature, but when I moved from a small village in Luxembourg to the
							Hague, I
							noticed a shift in landscape. Where there were fields and forests, there are now
							concrete
							walls and gravel roads. The city of the Hague has more inhabitants than my entire home
							country.<sup><a href="#" class="footnote-ref" data-footnote-id="footnote6">➶⁎̩͙ ⁑̩͙̩͙
									⁂̩̩͙͙</a></sup>
							<span id="footnote6" class="footnote-content" style="display: none;">
								<sup>➶⁎̩͙ ⁑̩͙̩͙ ⁂̩̩͙͙</sup> As of 2024, the population of the Hague is 720.085, whereas
								Luxembourg’s population stands at 661.594.
							</span> Compared to my hometown, everything felt gigantic. Everything felt intriguing.
							When
							the pace of the city started to feel overwhelming, I discovered hidden green spaces –
							community gardens<sup><a href="#" class="footnote-ref"
									data-footnote-id="footnote7">⊱⚘¨༺❀༻¨⚘⊰</a></sup>
							<span id="footnote7" class="footnote-content" style="display: none;">
								<sup>⊱⚘¨༺❀༻¨⚘⊰</sup> A community garden is a plot of land that is divided between a
								group of people either individually or collectively, usually in urban areas.

							</span> – that reminded me of the tranquility I’ve missed. Participation in
							these
							spaces is what creates the community of the garden. The garden can only thrive from
							collaborative group effort. Only people who care for each other and their environment
							can
							create such a space by working with their hands, mind and senses.
						</p>

						<p>
							The first community garden I visited was Spinozahof , known as the beautiful oasis in
							the
							center of the Hague. Spinozahof consists of multiple plots that individuals can rent.
							Among
							various other activities, once a week people come together to work individually in their
							own
							plots or collectively in the garden. On a Saturday, I helped with pruning and
							composting.
							The process intrigued me, because compost transforms from trash to treasure to trash to
							treasure,… Compost embodies the cycle of life, from decomposed organic matter to
							nourishment
							for plants, returning to earth to restart the cycle.<a id="bibref-15" href="#reference15"
								class="bibliography" data-bibliography-id="referenc15">[15]</a>
						</p>

						<p>
							While the cycle of composting appears less significant in its scale, recognizing its
							interconnectedness with broader phenomena, allows us to actively participate in it. In
							ecology, for instance, the human is an integral part of nature, rather than its
							dominator.
							This perspective is deeply rooted in the Maori, the indigenous tribes of New Zealand,
							who
							take part in a spiritual exchange with nature.<a id="bibref-16" href="#reference16"
								class="bibliography" data-bibliography-id="referenc16">[16]</a> In Maori tradition,
							birds hunted
							from
							the forests are ceremonically cooked over sacred stones by priests, who then eat some
							and
							give the rest to the hunters. Afterwards the priests return a talisman, typically a
							stone,
							to the forest. This ritual is known as ‘mauri’ which symbolizes gratitude and
							acknowledges
							the birds as a gift. Within this cycle exists a symbolic exchange of care: the forest
							provides for hunters, who provide for priests, who give back to the forest. This
							exchange of
							giving and receiving underscores the interconnectedness and mutual respect between the
							human
							and the natural environment.
						</p>

						<h3 id="subchapter-3.2">A recipe book</h3>

						<p>
							Thinking further about food and the environment, I got involved in the Foodsharing
							initiative, founded by Valentin Thurn in 2012 in Germany. This initiative combats the
							global
							challenge of food waste. Around 1.3 billion tons of food are wasted each year, which is
							approximately one third of the world’s food.<a id="bibref-17" href="#reference17"
								class="bibliography" data-bibliography-id="referenc17">[17]</a> This initiative doesn’t
							only help
							saving
							food from being thrown away, being involved in such projects contributes to positive
							change
							and builds a community. My roommates and I had a routine of heading to Delft every
							Saturday
							to save food. Within the foodsharing group of Delft, we could sign up for one out of
							three
							supermarkets to collect food that was no longer considered sellable, which we then
							delivered
							to a community fridge. A shared fridge where everyone can take what they need. In 2021,
							I
							hosted an event in KABK, distributing some of the saved food to peers. Later, I gathered
							the
							recipes that my peers sent me of the meal they cooked with the ‘wasted’ food. In the
							end,
							rather than the recipe book itself, the true outcome were the establishment of personal
							connections. The shared spirit of giving and receiving united everyone in a
							collaborative
							project.

							<h2 id="epilogue">Conclusion</h2>

							<p>
								Through the exploration of the multiple facets of care, it becomes evident that care is
								not
								only a fundamental aspect of human connection, it’s a complex concept that is deeply
								intertwined in power dynamics, societal norms and ethical considerations. The spectrum
								of
								care encompasses nurturing, responsibility, and vulnerability.
							</p>

							<p>
								In conclusion, my journey has deepened my understanding of nurturing relationships
								within my
								practice. By recognizing the roots of care, we become aware of its perceptions and the
								importance of fostering equality and fairness in our environment. The example of the
								Casco
								Art Institute illustrates how we can rethink old habits through collective efforts.
								Being
								open and vulnerable is not a weakness, but it shows care and honesty and participating
								in
								some seemingly simple acts can cultivate deep bonds and create a sense of belonging. In
								an
								increasingly fragmented world, care can be woven through by daily rituals and acts of
								kindness. We have observed the various scales of the giving and receiving cycle, from
								small-scale composting initiatives to larger rituals, creating community. Engaging in
								the
								ritual of exchanging letters back and forth fosters care and connection in our daily
								lives,
								because we need to actively seek the time and energy to do so. These rituals become
								gifts,
								constantly kept in motion, like the garden of my grandfather. It has the potential to
								evolve, extend, transform, offering endless possibilities for growth.
